# Dynamic Neural Network
This Repository contains collection of programs of Neural network created from scratch.
<br>
1. Creation of 2 synthetic datasets.<br>
2. Creation of simple Feedforward Neural Network.<br>
3. Using 4 active functions : ReLu, Sigmoid, Leaky ReLu, Softmax <br>
4. OOP based Neural Network.<br>
5. Neural Network with given Hidden Layers (dynamic settings).<br>
